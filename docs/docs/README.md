# Overview
The aim of this project is to provide a quick way for those who spend
more of their life glued to a desktop operating system rather then their
mobiles.

The Monzo CLI does this by making itself present in your machine's terminal,
addressable with the name `mzo`.

Each command can be invoked with the `--help` option which can be used to
explore all available commands/options.

```bash
$ mzo --help
Usage: mzo [options] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  balance  View account's current balance.
  login    Authorization & session management
  logout   Logout of authenticated session.
```

The installation, set-up process, and usage should be accessible enough for both
command-line veterans and toe-dippers alike. Let me know if you have any
problems and I'll update and clarify the documentation.
